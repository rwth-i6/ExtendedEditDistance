The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement on Tehran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
At the meeting it will go, but also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two state solution under discussion.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington condemned the ongoing Israeli settlement construction, and Netanyahu blames a lack of faith in the peace process.
By Obama's advertised deal with Iran's nuclear program has deteriorated further the relationship of the two.

In an emergency, a professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon lamb with a slightly tremulous voice told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to stress that his "sweet dog" but still live and probably was excited, and he said that the families of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block was: "To me, it does so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by lamb.
There was no indication that lamb that taught online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, two had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he has a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, according to the police shot and killed at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Wednesday said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 pm.
He said that lamb has made the fatal emergency sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Einkesselte lamb life, as the police took him.
A day after the shootings at the university, the students and staff forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still are trying to get a picture of it, what motivated lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, Burmese, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they were on his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had lamb mentioned in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the department of social sciences and history, which includes 17 faculty members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there have been some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the lamb said he seemed a little too excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Mikel Sykes, another student, said that lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 / 15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policies meant that the promotion for the lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr lambs idea."
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus police later found lambs track, when he returned to Mississippi arriving from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, killed lamb selbstmit a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb came to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He holds a PhD in education in the spring.
One of the lambs of longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her the guitar playing.
At that time, it was the women flock.
All the girls melted away, if he was, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the suburb of Brandon Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency, lamb said "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O Steen, said that she had been divorced for 15 years, but have remained friends and had a daughter, now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O Steen said he had never met lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Juleps Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he had lamb and Prentiss Night at the end of the night saw 5 September for the last time, after lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no indication that anything is wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in the cleanup efforts and joking with each other.
I think they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, took part in a candlelight ceremony on Tuesday evening about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vigil, during the Universitätschor sang "bright Morning Star" and "amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students to return home," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency Prentiss has described as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.

Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
Professionally, the premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royalty, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it is increasingly clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simuliertes yawn and an arm's length away, to be on a date with the Princess of Wales.

UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter, as some Republicans are trying to draw from the upper echelons in polls down Donald Trump, it did not work (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed in double digits, and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously, what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul Donald Trump.
Of course, it is still too early in the term.
No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of which have also won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth now see Trump's stamina and begin to get their dollars flow in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase.
Trump's popularity ratings have shot up to 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul in a positive way.
By the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP - GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
Last week, in a poll by CNN / ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans, Trump's temperament is not a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters inclined to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president, ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first primary state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a leader, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament is not passe to the White House, ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
If your scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If you are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten from the past week after a survey by CNN / ORC say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had not the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared with only 28% of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, shows that a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump is still almost every.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely contributes to Trump's leadership during the anti - Trump Support diffusely distributed on more than a dozen other candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September, however, shows that harvests the majority support in a hypothetical head to head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump.
He has 33 points against Carly Fiorina 13 point lead, 14 points, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is a head to head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head to head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans says that they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that they have found their voices.
Of course, a lot can happen in order to change this, and no one can really say, never to change their minds.
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment of other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion, are twice as often for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called "rapists" in his campaign speech to two months of immigrants from Mexico, immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic language will keep crucial Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs efforts.
But after the new ABC / Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it is apparently also do Donald Trump.
The frustration over the government climbs to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now about half of support from Republican voters, especially by their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans say in the new Monday - ABC / Post poll, they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Bloomberg / Des Moines Register in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans on the Republicans in Congress are frustrated, exasperated with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "same vein."

"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31.688 blooded fans - and the word held in Munich.
They showed a focused and committed performance without having to shine.
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus.
2011 stumbled here also Borussia Dortmund (1: 3).
But the Bavarians, duels with Greek teams in seven European Cup unbesiegt, did not want to be the next victim.
They went bravely ran in their offensive efforts, but often too unimaginative to works.
The attacks were too often taken by game shift to Douglas Costa left, against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui rarely occurred.
Muller had more luck than his flank from the right half of the field in the top left Toreck hit from the right.
In the 67th minute, the world champion's possible 2: 0.

Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers, thus not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long term study.
The good news: Not decreases the risk quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
It is clear from the long term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
The risk of losing their teeth early compared with nonsmokers, smokers that you up to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
Causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the tooth meat stresses the DIfE.
For this gum disease, smoking is a risk factor, say the authors.
The connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
Unknown to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research. "
However, it could take more than ten years before the risk back to the level of nonsmokers sinke, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
We need to persuade people to be smoking, study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE said: "Smoking shortens the life."
Not to smoke is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to a good dental health into old age according to our findings.
In Germany are affected about 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of toothlessness, DIfE shared with.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increase the risk for early tooth loss.
The new long term study untermauere the findings.

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more traditional dishes in its operation.
"We want to set up a system, which the public trust," the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
The Swede has to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
By TTIP is the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration see specifically that the EU countries and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment Court.
They should come to equal parts of the EU, the US and from third countries.
There is also, for the first time, a second instance.
It would make it possible to appeal against sentences.
So far the procedures involved with each other agreed to referee a chance to appeal against their sentences did not exist.
In the debate over the past few months has become clear that the old system of ISDS citizens are not familiar in terms of fairness and justice, said Malmström.
In the long run they will work according to their own figures on an international investment tribunal.
There could then be resolved, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
The investor state arbitration required mainly by large corporations (ISDS) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, riding on the company compensation at the expense of the taxpayer, can scuttle national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.
First opinions anti - TTIP organizations like Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
Criticism was, above all, that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans, on the other hand, a major advance.
The Commission was prepared to take on board in the spring with other EU trade ministers in the reform of key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules restrict the legal possibilities of the economy.
Small and medium sized companies in particular could be adversely affected, they said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement can be concluded TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations run since the middle of 2013.
The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States.
Originally a framework for the agreement are already at the end of this year.
This date is no longer tenable.

There is a rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring ground assault series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.

Jeremy Corbyn's debut in the Time of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's eagerly awaited debut in the Time of the Prime Minister
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in the Time of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will probably rise up to make the first of his six preset questions shortly after midday, with his performance of the media and the Labour MP for the area will be examined.
He called for "less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he might skip some sessions to be left to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet, and after his speech to the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday to remain in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has provoked criticism from a number of Tory most recent and is at the heart of several covers stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he had "been in a respectful silence" and he had "recognised the" heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they are called to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him initially as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences are also within Labour 'stack' after Mr Corbyn's remarks to the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour amendments on the table to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the cap of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman of the Tory leader David Cameron, since he is, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 comments.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will do both "repartee" and arguing with barbs and instead made to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister will represent him, if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak from time to time, and that he raised, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, in order to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove themselves from the policy in the style of an "opinion" theater, which is often linked to the Time of the Prime Minister, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and its position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and needs major reform.

Justin Bieber, a megastar.
A paltry 21 years young, Hänfling Frise with upper Chi emails.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is hard to 100 million euros.
Rather, even more.
Monsieur Bieber currently is in Berlin.
And the generation defeated rotates through.
As Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15 - year old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Pole sits on the cold stone slabs of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber construction: Here is her idol, whose poster plenty hanging in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives, the day costs just as much as their mom deserves Ewa in the half year.
If at all.
It says: "My th would actually have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I fulfilled a dream."
Compulsory education?

Metcash starts Bodenständigkeits campaign to fight Aldi- incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an ALDI march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a Bodenständigkeits campaign to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in a $700 million - ALDI - invasion.
While although prepared for the opening of the first 120 stores and two distribution centres in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets to strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build on the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media just about events such as Adelaide's show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as find Simmo DUNS borough distributed in IGA stores samples and shopkeepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Fußballliga to loyal customers.
It is expected that if the wholesaler for food, alcohol and devices holds its annual investor Strategietag Metcash released more details of its defence strategy on September 29.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs Oststaaten IGA network.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Oststaaten.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that ALDI is twelve months after opening its first markets around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states each time and will take away all the existing players, but mainly independent retailers sales.
According to a report published in this week, the Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that $360 million in sales per year and Metcash IGA retailers could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that although next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in Wa and achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and grocery store and the amounts based on Metcashs high fixed costs Metcash could cost around $13 million of earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Oststaaten, mainly at ALDI and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found out that IGA - buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes Metcashs sales in food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016, will fall by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager told Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, at a business lunch in Melbourne today that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade, Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Douglass.
But it is believed that a member of Metcash has been in contact with Mr Douglass last week.
IGAs market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcashs food and grocery retailer, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, which reflects the operational debt reduction while putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler refuses and investing more than $150 million to improve sale prices align with Cole's and the region for centuries in hundreds of products every week and IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
Metcashs chief executive officer Ian D. Ferrin, and D. Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes will lay in Elan and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the view of the Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as "Special KS" came into the spotlight by the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice had to be separated by the referee, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he was a tennis racquet after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual artist behind Bernard against Great Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals.
"One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that, in my view, a little Thanasi was drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes, but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I believe that he was treated a little too tightly.
He is a very mature 19 years, he works very hard, and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important qualifiers, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return, as a long term is an integral part of the team. "
"First of all, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closing the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and gave everyone who tried to come into the country illegally, all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed as hundreds of migrants in a no man's land on the border ansammelten and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence, stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries for an unknown period of time and built tents and settled down there.
But frustrations rose.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants "open the border!" Chanted and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some were back in protest of food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) will be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
It must be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian / Serbian border came one day after the bloc of 28 nations could not agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers, however, agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece überrumpelten. They expressed their hope that, in the next month or until the end of the year, finally reached an agreement that the EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary,.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
Hungary continued, however, his hopes for a speedy action by Brussels or by its neighbors.
A state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could hammer roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, meanwhile, that his country also plan the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania, in order to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that the most purchased are economic migrants who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees, have the right to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU countries, including Germany,.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing the border or the damage of 4 meters (13 feet) high fence, the government built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime. These laws are also higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation that has arisen as a result of the mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still agree with procedural or the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from the Associated Press, heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs have already seen for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, national security adviser for Orban, said that authorities erwischten 45 people in an attempt to cross the border, 15 others were already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come across, they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly to repair the fence.
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon with barbed wire to close the borders, arrived on Tuesday morning.
Confusion surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians hineinzudrängen opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a crowd there.
About 20 managed to get inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's halved ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58% previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions, it is clear which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent than the other candidates in the election.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but these protrusions have reduced.
Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is here only by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton still has a large lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support it because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters are also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency in the balance, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it.
If Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders.
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead before Sanders, will increase by 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
55% of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most eligible" has risen.
However, on the question of what is important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions of eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is the primaries as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in a number of important characteristics in their party's primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views in general.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State continues to be asked, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans is now unhappy with its statement, while only about a third is satisfied.
Public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans have said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her is even worse.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them as a whole: Only 32 percent among registered voters see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not regard it as an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump will get good marks for leadership, however.
Of the six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush cut best with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders is more likely to be honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is close behind at nationwide survey on Donald Trump
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest poll from CBS News / New York Times
On the two candidates dropped dramatically since losing half of the support of voters in the new poll, and others.
Republican voters nationwide continues to support Trump in large numbers. The support is growing by 23% in the latest CBS poll, which was conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the survey on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is good for demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is smitten with Wisconsins governor Scott Walker, of the deepest has fallen, from 10% to now 2% support in the last month.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC poll, which was released last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he lands behind the Trump in 19% support among Republicans, with 32% support.
The most recent poll by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well before Carson.
With a view to a rising Carson in the last week, Trump found some side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for that, Trump's faith in question.
"We need energy," Trump said during a campaign appearance in Iowa last Saturday.

Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Baruch College - newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a ritual of bullying a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.
Brutally attacked members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta PSI fraternity chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said that he had been charged with related eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and have been repeatedly attacked, while he tried to reach out on a frozen field on a goal.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta PSI fraternity called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to the police.
They had the time to switch to Deng's clothing, Googling his symptoms and to contact Andy Nordic, the national president of the Brotherhood, however, in order to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the Brotherhood in principle about the police chief Michael Deng," said Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng have been repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student dies every year since 1970 to the harassment," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng's, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be brought to justice, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a prosecution for murder, the third degree for the first five members.
32 members of the Brotherhood, including Mr volumes., are also accused of religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We do not want to blame only the people involved, but if there is one organisation that, officially or unofficially, has sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group.
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know how long it would take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the end.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike and took 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor, such as the economy and the financial assets.
As a result, representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period which is needed for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, market participants could say, however, that all the excitement was due to an increase in interest rates may be overdone.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal levels, but still too low to conduct a seismic shock many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a look based on historical trends, as some sectors of the economy might respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency that asset returns are strangled 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's rate hikes.
More specifically, the market is mostly in the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike, pretty flat for the next 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 per cent in the past six past cycles, according to a recent analysis, the Bob doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the growth cycle and begin the return to reduce.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote interest rate increases.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.
Most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank was at 118 rate hikes since 1950 only nominal GDP twice under 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question, "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have taken throughout the year on a Fed rate hike, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trading is only a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, all increase cycles have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP from 1950 to the present day and put on - recession highs very soon after the start of the recovery in the shadows," according to the report.
By contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed has maintained since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are now 74 months.
The fixed income was also on the market as volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is pretty similar.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than that of stocks, if they change their strategic course.
With bond yields seem to change the direction, as soon as the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle.
Bond yields fall at the end of the growth cycle, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will mean that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
Higher income often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short term rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, lending margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightened its strategy.
By and large companies that handle the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of its debt as well.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to react, three months after an initial rate hike in a very positive way," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with a strong balance sheet companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 percentage points each) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts disagree, how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station because of its "dumbing down"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
House colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" on Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the channel, to prove that he does something the private broadcasters do not.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that public service radio is "verdumme" and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems like - I do not use the word" verdummen "- but it seems to turn on Classic FM," he said.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, The Brits seem to be just under a different name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and information to the public.
What I learned from Radio 3, I will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I think it really is important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience, as it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for Culture, Media and Sport for the selection of commercial rivals to engage on the feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins resorted to the BBC - the musical talent show The Voice, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
See you why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show, with Paloma Faith and boy George as a judge, "was produced on a special BBC way '.
He added that he would find that the company "a hit from our own stall," when we launch the next time an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future or to spend tax payers money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of the year 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday has curbed spending in November
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping geboomt and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stagnate, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total spending for August, the lowest increase in growth, the lowest since records began in 2000 with only five per cent increase over the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnant, after new figures indicate only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has developed in the course of time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the Guardian IMRG sales index.
He explained that the online sales increased from three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people were able to shop online, and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now the commute, and we will probably experience reduced growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place each year on the last Friday in November,.
Last year rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bargains and some dealer websites plummeted.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyer is fighting for bargains, could deter buyers to make purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending just over £1 of £5 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now done via web shops.
More than a quarter of the people at the same time buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.

B & Q boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increase behind
As a result, 200 more northern shops aimed at artisans, will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British put down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can deal with a hammer or a brush to the painting of walls, you are now seems to have become a minority.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out central jobs in their homes, as the boss of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at budget prices is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more northern shops, directed at craftsmen and to close 60 stores of B & Q.
Mrs. Laury said that it wants to employ more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchases in the store are made by women.
At the moment, outweigh the men on the staff.
They said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends, which have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: "There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move it more towards a balance.
Basically half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of one of Britain's leading companies listed in the FTSE100 index has also umstruktiert her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team filled with women, including its CEO and CFO.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women to our Board.
Kingfisher announced a drop in half year profit and sales, after the group had trained the costs of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns B & Q and northern, 200 open new branches.
Officials of Aich / DOB for infidelity in court
On land court Klagenfurt, will have to answer on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball - Deputy Master Aich / DOB of embezzlement and tax evasion.
Known to the accused is not guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse of office.
By this accusation, he has been legally acquitted in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to prosecutor Robert Riffel had crystallized in the preliminary examination, that the defendants in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of club accounts, they were in their functions with kidneys, used for private purposes.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial crimes.
This fact arbitration Schöffensenats's chairman, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is supposed to be negotiated at a later date.
For infidelity Verwurf would be put the defence that the club has never arisen at a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials have charged only expenses and the sports club, for which she worked from 1982 to 2011, in which they had invested a lot of time and money, led out of the debt - the liabilities amounted approximately 44,000 euros around 600,000 Schilling (in 2001).
"Back then we were before the situation: We lead the club further or to block us?," told one of the defendants, in the bread large professional auditor of the financial district.
With his colleague and co, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have got money to prehistoric Cho, our life insurance policies as collateral in the bank," he said at the hearing.
With the club had been agreed upon, you are free to manage the money, it can only be made no debt.
You had been decided - in the financial success of the payment of expenses retroactively until 1991.
So you have a portion of the expenses paid only years later, in 2003, was on the account as a plus.
It seemed also provide package deals and no detail, explained the former chairman of the events.
The two defendants jointly managed the accounts and savings books, the second defendant said.
Why the payments to the club had not been disclosed in detail, the judge asked.
The club was not interested in the detail for the financial governance, have been important is only the freedom of debt, as the answer.
When started against an official investigation on charges of abuse of office in 2011, a total of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
These are reserves, said the defendants.
The securities account ran on behalf of the second defendant, and was not known, according to his statement to the club.
"Why?" The judge wanted to know.
That the respondent knew no answer for a long time.
Then he said that he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something happens to him, no one would have known of this money, asked the public prosecutor in the area.
The Mitangeklagte had been informed, the official is justified.
This transfer was formulated as "damage reparation."
Why concept?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
It said the first defendant that he was not in agreement with this formulation, because the club was never a damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says: "Are you all off the hook."
"I am a legal representative?" He asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never paid a penny, have charged he just miles of money and diets.
In diets, he charged into the club of 1,000 euros per month, but the actual cost is much higher, he added.
Accurate records for the early years did not show the defendants.
They had been kept after an audit in which everything has been judged to be correct, not more, they said.
Miles of money had also referred to the second defendant.
All fixes need to be made in cash, so he had to drive from his home in international market due to the bank, he said in his statement.
The main negotiations will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.

Time of the decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world observes, if the Fed comes together in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, in order to make the important decisions, whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
"For the first time, we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero field and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds are well against such a move.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8pm CET
Shooter at Delta State University left letters of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before he shot and killed his colleagues later in the day, Shannon lamb wrote a note to say that he say "sorry" for the first murder and wanted to know, "he could undo it," authorities said on Tuesday.
In Gautier, Mississippi, the police said that lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning
And said that he had shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb, the emergency call centre staff said that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will bother," but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he gave him not.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of lamb, 45, said: "I am doing it so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note lamb drove 300 miles on Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, when police became him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr lambs idea."
Despite reports on Monday that lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss, Shawn O Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years, described as a 'good man'.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said that her daughter, Prentiss "were absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that lamb had phoned relatives at a certain time on Monday to say to them, "he does not go to jail."
When police officers drove him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night should overtake me, lamb his car to the side, fled on foot and ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb was awarded a doctorate of Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life LAU on the University's website.

Eurowings, Lufthansa builds to the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's approximately 1,000 executives will cost the corporation into the workplace.
Close work with the pilot, there are, however, new negotiations.
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the cheap subsidiary Eurowings.
The goal of the realignment is an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, shared with the airline on Wednesday.
Among other things, there is no more board for the passenger business in future with Lufthansa.
The budget airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
The executive team at CEO Carsten Spohr will in future be responsible for Eurowings Karl Ulrich Garnadt.
With the reconfiguration Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the company intends to compete in the future against Ryanair and Easyjet.
So far, the organisation of 120 000 employees strong company was complex.
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In conflict with the Pilotenvereinigung Cockpit (VC) fare, the negotiations should be resumed after the strike halted by the courts on this Thursday.

The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
Background is the austerity plan, together with the transitional care of the pilots "wings."
It stipulates that the Lufthansa outsource routes to the corporation's own cheap Eurowings line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League defeat by Manchester.
While this brought the outside left defender for wines and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not on the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20 year old Shaw had plummeted in the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow, or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy coming to Manchester United with 18 plays it very hard, and then fantastic, and then this happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He wept.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that lasts six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed to be fortunate to escape a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, has not punished the Mexicans.
Van Gaal had suspected that the Italian referee got it wrong.
You can judge for yourself, if I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw account was: "I would like to thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has an extra incentive to recover until next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip were the PSV coach, said: "It is a very serious violation."
If a player leaves the place with this type of injury, are all very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult, because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you were then told that it is a very serious injury, that is not good," said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing that I could see was the ball, which was travelling in the other direction, so that it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad and I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital, after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows better The Lorax?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company super camp, and continues: "Funny, moving, and creative with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children, because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead reflect a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed - Ville, where all of nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree," reads one, a love interest, however, Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage, who died in 1991, was completely unknown.
As if that were not suspicious enough, the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed - Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book. Here is an unnamed boy Lorax Thneed rope ends once - ler, as the local environment by the greedy, trees be cases, despite the protests of the name give a Hock schnurrbärtigen nature, "it speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, of The Lorax 20 times in a row has not read to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but gave no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but when you look at the squad, which was selected for the tour of England, a repeat of the 3 - 0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out a home victory.
Alastair Cook's side is probably less than it was three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars from 2012, only a youthful and positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin - Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth leaves England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex catastrophic effect.
The decision to let Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.
Long ago, the race would be extended from Lyth, but he had control over its own destiny.
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, is another opportunity.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he is not so good services rendered, and this does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.
The question of how much time a test - a man gets to put his character is difficult.
Lyth had seven opportunities, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and abroad.
The only criticism one can make that Jonathan Trott, England first began in the Caribbean, when Lyth was in peak form, but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex is catastrophic, and he is a hit man, which I appreciate.
He is an X factor - cricket player, what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season, when he scored against us on a Trent Bridge pitch 236, which hit us very much.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the team at a position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen beat along with Cook, which would provide an extra spin - Bowler and receive four Quicks appeared on, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a man cannot beat them, and this has already shown that he is a vicious guy of cricket players left - handed.
Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.
He has made three hundred runs straight away and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari is the spinner in the squad as back up, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People might see his statistics, an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball, and think it is a punt, but there are a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of the batsman Mahela Jayawardene from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is for the white ball - phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful force in the setup.
I always felt that he has created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are in line with the above.
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben stokes, is not used in the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some will disagree, but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken with a light heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain's exit from the EU) could gain access, when the economy is in a slump until 2017
David Cameron's crude Neuverhandlungs Strategy, in order to keep Britain in the EU, is deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy Corbyn "Is it yes or no?" The leaders of Labour and the TUC for Europe on Tuesday the Serbs boycotted it.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn's and Nigel Farage's.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, it is so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, and not always from their own fault, Britain's own agendas are saturated with divided concessions and disruptive changes, which they usually do not want to.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it may be, if they threaten the social protection.
We could also call Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend who wants an outside view of Britain inside the EU tent - "Let us not only in France," says Berlin - and you can look through that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some cities have come to the point where it is no matter to them, whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them, as it happened in the overly long help arrested as Thatcher (11 years), Kohl and Mitterrand (14) (16).
France's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a declining force.
Poland may soon be a left a right nationalist government, Spain.
It is hard to imagine that they will plug a leg to help the Selfie Britons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore may be planning some sort of minister even suspected of deliberately not helpful comments, quite the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to speed up the process of Brexit, my friend.
"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the referendum in 1975 but not inspired by Tony Benn, that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the ore - euro opportunists, who has made a name for himself as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all its craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This was part of the medley of tax - pseudo non - nationals and foreigners who own most of our major newspapers to describe - rogue, phone hack.
Tony Blair really thought much about it, but found that if one is sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distributed bananas to distract him, rather than to be his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was Blairianer more than Blair himself, when he opposed to Cameron's referendum Eddy, because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press has never forgiven him as well.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back in Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he needed to waste no more time for me - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy to repeat the 80's, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Detroit, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I am sometimes kind - in the development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye trend and the more wild climes of skeptics Klein Engländerismus everyone can say yes.
It is what "A Benn, not a Bennite" Hilary Benn said on the radio and on television this week, as the scouts fought in it, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father on television that tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without having to go too far and lose his cabinet job.
Hilarys fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC and his colleagues told MPs after all the reports on its closing session on Monday evening.
Whatever the sentimental nature wants to give bottom - up image of Corbyn - remember that he has even touched me - news - discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock, and above all, in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which allowed him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership, in accordance with its Bennite Belagerungs economy, anti - capitalist past, is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes to the narcissism of small differences.
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC launches a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in particular.
If all of this can be useless, why should waste political capital of Paris or Berlin - they have also distrustful voters - in order to make concessions to the British?
The US is already pretty disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction of the Tory government in power, which at the start on Monday, I was reminded of something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise report by Public Health England on electronic cigarettes
Claims of a publicly funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined The Lancet, by they criticise the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE, the "principle" report published last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis," based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the allegations "built on sand or stone."
Martin McKee, professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that electronic cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking," based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened in order to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) Multi Criteria Decision Analysis - in order to have their opinions about the damage a synthesis of a number of products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape said that is a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose directors have previously received from British American Tobacco (BAT) means for an independent study.
He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding, which he joined after reports were received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International, she added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered, but it includes several popular electronic cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate an industry funding in the paper.
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco control of PHE.
The group's research "tellingly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Cape well.
However, none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed.
McKee and Cape said that the allegations of PHE, that "there is no evidence so far that e - cigarettes serve as a way for smoking for children or non smokers were" premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that has already responded to the allegations by BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we have to continue to study the long term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking, the national health system costs £2 billion per year.
Through the clear proof of current evidence that electronic cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, we meet our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used, in order to make the kind of programmes, which will not be sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for having to place public service programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, for solid window against their rival's most popular shows and channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried, without success, to get in touch with the BBC in his time at Channel 4 for six years.
"I would have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sends, which is also clearly shown by not subsidized rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which in the medium or long term, I do not think it is a good idea, you should commission its production at least or with programs that others do not.
They send The Voice in a prime time slot, because they want to reach the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could also be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a programme, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am doing my best to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support. "
His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes that give back to what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that public service rather niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they are doing their work, and they can argue that if they go on missions to justify broadcasting fees of £4 billion of their hypocritical," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
They put them in a window in which no one would ever see it.
The broadcasting fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Thinking of you all, of course, we all think that one gets a great value for £150 per year here, but for people who for £150 is a lot of money, wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 - chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission "to inform, educate and entertain."
He said that little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education, he said that there were 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should be making an example of public service television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels, in order to make everything available online.
'Genetics' brain cells can control by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems, which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses, which have high frequencies to the human ear, in order to be heard.
The stimulus work through the activation of motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sono Genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms are usually not on ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he was found to increase the ultrasonic waves, which then invade the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP - 4 Ion channels and cells are found in the membranes of some of the worms.
The sound waves cause the opening up of these Ion channels and activating the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that bear some of their motor neurons TRP - 4 Ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the change in motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that sono Genetics could have some advantages to this technique.
In contrast to light that needs to be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue low frequency ultrasonic waves can happen without hindrance and can then be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that it is possible to make the human neurons have been temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep!
The ads embarrass Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti - arms fairs - watch video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle zerschmetternde leg shackles!
Cluster bombs!
And cause electric shock that nagging pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad is a parody of fighting for the world's largest arms fair, which was produced by Amnesty International, the British government's willingness to bring into the spotlight, reimbursing weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the Excel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many of the posters can be seen at bus stops and subway trains and require a second look.
"Important notice: Drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR (Docklands Light Railway)?" Reads one of the London Underground and the hallmark of the DLR line that converts to a picture of a tank in the font types.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR ride... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "ad space hack packs," a £6 -Pack of Allen keys, which maintains that "gain access to about one third of the bus - advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London will take place this Plaka animal "vandalism" is not funny.

After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be critical and try to bring political work for the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists make is to work with activists in protest movements and say that they need to go out there in the real world, so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti - arms trade - posters greets commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, the nonprofit is working with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP - creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that reigned around the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space of the excel calendar - and thought: "We give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "through the Einbläuen with bright colors and animation, it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job, they help us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the show," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair dates from the field within excel, where exhibitors reimbursing fantastic euphemistische products.

Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago, I moved as even forgotten 19 year old in a student residence, which is still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strained smile of those who I have annoyed - and to the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The collection in student residences ranges from slightly fraught to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to bleat: Tell people where you are coming from, whether and where you've taken sabbatical where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you HAHAHA "frankly Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Set questions and show interest.
It draws the conversation and helps you to find the people who you are in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyelashes were on fire and the fire extinguisher.
Let people.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and local venues, but they are also the places where people dress and her underwear right back.
Related to this: Remember not to start at the university with a relationship
Introvertierte get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space on space walk - culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave, that I get the energy back, which I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to sense when a Man of conviviality anzuklopfen is exhausted - and send him a text message instead.
Speaking of call waiting: Do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Close friendship with baking.
As you begin the university at the height of the Back - mania, the beating on the doors of people, in order to present themselves with a plate full of brownies, is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 "" Welcome to the neighborhood, so I have something baked. And now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions. "
Offering homemade treats is a good way to close friendships.
Their roommates feel obliged to entertain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a tasty morsel.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
As a result of poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat, people are sleeping, if you knock on the door.
To steal food, is a common crime in student residence halls.
Of course the claws of chicken is a theft, but is also taking a drop Milchs for your tea?
Check this with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say, to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal more balanced than my resident their milk added a detergent to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should make no noise, which prevents people from sleeping or at work.
It is not just trying to be a decent man, but in the truest sense of the proverb you belong to the people who live in glass houses.
A girl on my floor asked their neighbors if it makes them a little, to make a little quieter drum & bass, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and they had a test in the morning.
They responded with even more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., they made their neighbours kindly still sleep two hours before they had their own music plärren, completed their door and came to their three hour examination.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move randomly in the same student residence?
Conversely, it would not be abysmally embarrassing when you need to keep a newcomer for your future Ehepartnerin they yummie food separate again and see them every day and see how it pulls all the common friends to come over?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot newcomer is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin, you try at least, convince your abdominal a little common sense.
Lie in the exciting moment where you notice that someone has his keys in his not verschlossenem rooms, the line between a Ulk and bullying is fine as it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments before he becomes a boomerang.
Give you by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but you never someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and put the key in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tackern their possessions on the ceiling is not more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.
So, for example, for refugees, but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."
"I can show how to build cheap and good even today," says the 44 years old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are in the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created: It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are in the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people are to a large extent here.
In the face of the refugee flow, we also need adequate housing in the next few decades.
A very commonplace, three storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates the integration.
This is different, if it brings people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace, I go back again.
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.
This is manageable.
Six months has taken the construction.
This is appropriate.
The building regulations have complicated their plans?
Gildner: Construction law, I have learned through my project properly.
It is particularly complicated always expect the looming sword and the pitch regulation.
Gruselig.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is not the place for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents responded to her townhouse project?
Gildner: There have been those who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But do not tighten the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: Is true: We had a construction boom in the last five years in Germany, but luxury apartments have been built, can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message that ordinary people need housing too.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.
I show how we can still build well.
That is what this is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and dealt with environmental analysis.
IOS 9: How you get the new iPhone operating system, when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be obtained by going to the settings App, tap on "General" and then select "software update".
When it is ready, gives you the option to download and then install the phone.
Some are met with problems after the installation, because they receive an error message that says that the "software update failed."
In order to circumvent the problem, it is recommended that users either to wait until the rush is decreasing or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting Apps to create space, but Apple has made less likely by the streamlining of the update, and it will be easier to do this if one uses a special tool to delete Apps and install it, once the process is completed.
It's worth it, to ensure that your phone is charged during the upgrade or is located in the vicinity of a charging device, so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, does not allow for Apple that the update will continue, as the phone may be halfway switched off and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosbergs only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto: "Full attack against its clear leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton in the fight for the world championship title in Formula 1."
The World Cup - Second stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before to separate in Singapore to this Sunday by the defending champions and two times champion Hamilton.
The Briton won seven of the previous 12 races and takes the floodlight - Grand Prix in the city state as well as a favorite in attack.
In 2009, and last year, the 30 year old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix, is still unclear.
For days, a brown haze hangs over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member.
The Chess Club "chess friends founded three months ago Bad Kissingen" has another member in its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, who was a passionate chess and tennis player, who has more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen to cure.
Gauselmann Espelkamp and fair is winner of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and an honorary citizen of the city.
The Chess Club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation to the chairman Alfred Klein.
So it is possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the Chess Club and friendly contact with Tennis Club "red and white" is seen as an expression of his commitment to the city.
The office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the old centre of Antoni Abbey have done together under the cloak of social foundation and the Count Stauffenberg place opened a new point of contact.
In addition to consultations, they can also take part in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically to the Count Stauffenberg place.
It has recently opened a new district office.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and two from now receive information on issues such as the care insurance or services of health and social care budgets.
For years, we provide with our outpatient care service that family carers are often left alone.
There are so many questions.
"Too often many services of the funds are not used, because the complexity of insurance is barely understood," explained the new house mistress Jutta Weigand, the divisional head old aid is also responsible for the "Amadeus" Antoni pen and the public hospital, as well as the outpatient service.
In addition to the discussions, the new district office but also on prevention, wellness and health courses.
To this end, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, we can take advantage of additional services such as fall prevention, memory training or physical therapy.
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, care and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and maintenance," Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis describing Diana.
The reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre are both business leaders especially in the demographic change.
Because it makes a good local infrastructure in the various districts of Bamberg in the future is essential.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) highlighted a "at the inauguration ceremony to dedicate the district office of loneliness in old age:" There are numerous events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular play pen.
This bar the social foundation of a great contribution that seniors can live as independently as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to noon.

Viennese architect Karl Mang 92 years died
Karl Mang, a doyen of the Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92 years already, as the artist house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang lose the artist house an honorary member, and at the same time, "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as it said in the broadcast.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann Mang during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952, he worked as a freelance architect, but was also active as a teacher, writer and Head.
From 1972 to 1983, he was President of the Austrian Institute for design.
In the 1980s, he was entrusted with the creation of the treasury at the Imperial Palace in Vienna and the reconstruction of the palace in the Austrian Theatermuseum buffets.

Silvia Müller - Gongoll and Frank Muller (from left) take on the practice of Karl Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Is also pleased with municipality Mayor Bernd Bormann Wirtschaftsförderin Uta Seim - Schwartz and grass village mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - grass village, on the other hand, was lucky: There, Dr. Frank Muller Felstehausen practice on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, says her husband Karl Heinrich, his successor in the next few months with a half point.
Müller opened after a renovation phase of the practice on 12 October, until then he invests EUR 310000 in the premises of the St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was love at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Muller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller - Gongoll years ago, are now completed their specialist training in the tops of hospital and next year also wants to join in the practice.
"We always had in mind that Miller would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was ready, I've simply called them."
The Muller couple liked the idea in the future to conduct their own practice in Nohant village.
"The close and constant contact with the patient are very attractive to us," says the 39 year old Miller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
He also see an advantage, soon to be his own boss.
And so it was agreed that Müller's bought the house with the practice.
Live, they will, however, continue to reside in breach - during.
There is the double family father Frank Muller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover was followed by stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a doctor in Sulingen, also he was appointed in 2009 as the senior emergency in the district of Diepholz and committed volunteer in the DRC will break during the Rat.

While the surgeon Dr. Karl Heinrich Felstehausen works as a doctor, his wife Ursel (entirely tin) has specialized in the gastroenterology.
The Miller, both Internists, want to establish themselves as family physicians.
"So the endoscopy comes out," says the 38 year old Silvia Müller - Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms look modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations and long time and loading - basic and need one more room.
In addition, the computer will be completely renovated.
A grant from the Miller as part of a funding programme from the district received a total of 50,000 euros (25,000 euros), as well as by the Samtgemeinde (12,500 euros) and the community (12,500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," said Mayor Bernd Bormann with community.
About 2000 patients come into practice every quarter according to Silvia Müller - Gongoll Felstehausen, about 500 in the northern German average practice.
There is yet another GP practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice of office by Frank Muller: The pharmacy is according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, they would be gone too.
Anyone who visited Müller's appointment looks to continue, especially in familiar faces: Takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaner of the Felstehausens.
With their departure ends an era in Asendorf, after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen schmunzelnd.
A little nostalgic, they have been for a long time.
"But we live in high moor even further and will certainly often see many patients," says the entirely tin.

Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will also ramped on our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain upright at the same time.
Still, it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could also make that 'of course'.
The care and safety of the people stand in the foreground.
Is also clear, "that it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even on the Austrian - Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is denied "corridor" - Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel further in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for the refugees.
Just saw that Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana, however, do not.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary -.
The border with Croatia is an external border of the Schengen area, on the other hand, already heavily controlled.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia will not seal its borders for refugees.
"Each EU member must fill out its obligations, otherwise the system may not work," Györkös Znidar noted.
As the Croatian government announced, had the first refugees already in the night hours on Tuesday tried to enter the border in Eastern past Tovarnik / Sid, in order to evade the registration.
The Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media since the Croatian Tovarnik constantly police vehicles with new refugees.
It was mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the next few days count his country with around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko politics.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian - Serbian border, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday in Beijing.
The government in Belgrade anweise denied, however, that it is the people to embark on certain routes: "Neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports is in any case a first bus in the morning with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, more buses are expected over the course of the day.
On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police has said that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually come to the postponement of the Balkan route to date already predicted by observers of Turkey - Greece - Macedonia - Serbia - Hungary on a track located to the west.
Croatia: "Extensive opportunities for border control"
Politics of Croatia's interior minister had previously stressed that his country was prepared for possible emergency situations appropriate plans in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
Details he was not, he however pointed out that Croatia as non Schengen members have extensive opportunities for border control.
We have strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia is a good testimony that since 2007, the EU partners represent the country consistently since then, as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serb side are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence to about 300 refugees.
According to Belgrade media reports she had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities remain the two crossings Horgos and Backi gradually continue to be completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nelise Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Horgos: It seems the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
Currently, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helper rates to migrants - and dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not without risk: In some parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia has still not cleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern has been sent to the border region.

Ecumenical Mannheim hospice support exists for 20 years
There is intense operation around the Mannheim parade ground.
People do their errands, some quick step, in part for a breath of fresh air.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim auto salons at Paradeplatz.
Keep city tracks.
Vibrant, long life in beautiful autumn sunshine and four large panels in the middle with the headline "Before I die I want..."
The Ecumenical hospice help drew attention to their 20th anniversary with this action and it is faced with mixed reactions.
"It is killed, so we are left with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," said Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical hospice help is also available for questions and discussions as the volunteer staff of the passersby.
While many a passerby spontaneously added to chalk and affirm the sentence about "my life," "read," "with the campers to travel through the United States," "stop the war" or "not suffer long, others are short, read, say phrases such as" so far, I am not yet "and then go on.
Always develop small discussions about the action itself, about life on the edge, dealing with the death.
Peter Hübinger is also currently on the ground.
"Only when I make clear that comes at the end of the world for me, I can live in a responsible manner," says the director of the work of Diakonischen Mannheim, which together with the Carita "is winner of the Ecumenical hospice help.
Therefore, this visible action is good for 20 year olds.
That not everyone wants to share publicly on the boards, but is understandable, because if it is a very personal thing.
The subject of death and dying is still riddled with taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement have helped a lot in the last few years, open for the people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The companion Sterbe- and sadness is one of the volunteers in the first hour.
Confronted by personal experience with the subject, they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice sought help by calling volunteers, they have reported immediately and had been present at the creation in 1995.
Gode cold belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanied the patients and relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospice of St. Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with their job and the lessons and experiences here.
"I see life from a different perspective, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the Ecumenical outpatient hospice service is free and independent of confession.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from individuals and foundations enables the training as well as training and supervision of Sterbe- and grief companion.
Every two years will be offered training for new employees.
The boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
It can also be noted further personal wishes on postcards.
FedEx - mixed results, reduced financial prospects for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans to pursue some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The shares fell about 2.5 percent in Premarket - 45 minutes before the opening of trading on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said that to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than its previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a survey by FactSet 10,84 $.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and be effective on January 4 and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that it expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year because of reduced costs, increased revenue and because of the growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns, if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade,."
The plans for the holidays - jobs were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to recruit additional workers, about the same number as last year, 90,000 to 95,000.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 percent from the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2,42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, predicted the twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has brought in the last few years there has been a decline in international priority shipment of sales in its unity Express shipping to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating income was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and even insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
The Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Disrespectful about them at one end of the ornate, two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will start on Thursday announced that the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate near zero since late 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal debt - and it is only about a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin Maklerfirma Bodies Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which confuses the financial market in itself.
About half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets expect the Fed waiting, however, with a key indicator that displays only a 30% chance of an increase.
This points to a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless the strategists to soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday 16.599,85 jumped on the Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert 228,89 points or 1.4%.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.
If you do it, "they would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets, so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
As recently as a month ago, the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
In spring and early summer, Yellen had said that this year they expect despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed, an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And even though inflation was consistently below the central bank's 2% annual target, the Fed's representative said that the main reason was the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market, "said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world had zuckten late last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat in this month, while the Dow is now at almost 10% below the peak in May.
For the Fed's representatives should influence the market turmoil the complex calculation when you increase the interest rate.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now says he predicted that they would wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is none of the Fed's main concern, so technically they should not be involved in their decision making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank was enormously in the last few years.
The mere hint of the former leader could "narrow" Ben S. Bernanke that the Fed's monetary expansion in 2013, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor the developments in other places, but also with other central banks, experts advise, in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the company's asset management Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, va., said this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements, which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is committed to a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should set only during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place aspects of financial stability, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England to set interest rates.
The recent turmoil do not come near this level, he said.
"It is certainly not in the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that they should rush ahead of time.

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy breastfeeding diet
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS tried, in a shocking way, educate women about how important good nutrition is during the silent era, it does so with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts, which are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher caloric intake is not the only dietary adjustment, should make the mothers.
Under the direction of Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, a recent study showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies, and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet can adversely affect the immune system of the child.
Exceptions to the new Bern Rieder sports hall
The council of Bern Ried approved Bauantrag expensive sports hall for the 2.3 million euros.
And he made an exception.
The roof should be flat for solar plant.
The plans for the long awaited turn pictures on Bern Rieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the recent council meeting, the elaborated Bauantrag was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The panel had previously decided, among other things, a request for a demands an "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" was for permission for a special form on the roof structure.
A "saddle roof with concentric First and roof should therefore be built on state '.
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar panels: "As a result, we get a wonderfully big southern roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again on the roof inclination for energetic reasons, unlike required in the development plan, is expected to fall below 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall will be significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was necessary because the construction plan on the roof slope will not permit "exceptions" - and the council of Bern Rieder usually rather restrictive in visa applications.
In turn created is not a recurring project: "We are creating a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The buildings at the centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Turn Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are calculated at cost.
Grants are expected by promoting education and grassroots sport.
The next procedural step the Bauantrag for 18 x 36 metres wide hall will now put to the test in the local office.

Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tight.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable home.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution of fighting on the German housing market have started a long time ago.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many cities.
They compete with low income citizens in the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, would need to be built each year 400,000 new units by 2020.
To this outcome is a study on behalf of the Associations Alliance "social housing."
By comparison, in this year will be finished in Germany 260,000 units.
This is a lack of 140,000 homes.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a reception accommodation after the first three months of their stay.
Many people will encounter in the housing market and line up in long queues in front of the apartments.
The German Federal Statistical Office lived in the last year, however, fewer than half of all asylum seekers for rent.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only on the rise in refugee numbers.
The study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years.
Germany sliding a housing deficit, which is increasing from year to year.
Currently lacked in the urban areas have already complained about / units, Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals lived in WG rooms in major cities of necessity.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in "Hotel Mama" because of the downturn in the housing market.
In the major cities in recent years, the number of square metres per head has fallen again for the first time.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance "social housing" proposes a fresh start.
There are new incentives to boost social housing again.
That could be made to the estate tax and the property taxes for subsidised housing will be temporarily suspended.
The alliance of attractive tax depreciation are also necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is already well in towns and cities.
A week after the start was on Monday evening, with 184 million euros, more than half of the roughly 300 million available have already been retrieved.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia a corridor
After Hungary is practically no longer go through, as more and more people choose the path of Croatia.
Zagreb announces to provide the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
Yet the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbour Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if it is necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko politics.
Located between Croatia and Austria, Slovenia is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian - Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees to Croatia are broken, to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had come over the border in Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually redundant.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for that possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
But there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up on the morning of the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia.
Most were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came with both bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to reach on foot on the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian / Serbian border the refugees not to border fences.
For the border strip carries other risks: There are still active mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Minesweepers are now rapidly to create a safe passage.
Come to Hungary, however, little more refugees after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police apprehended 366 people.
Just before close of play on Monday, it was still water.
The new Hungarian laws classify the damage and the removal of the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 were therefore initiated criminal proceedings.
Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and the expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority you have received a total of 94 asylum applications in the new "transit zones" set up at the border on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there 40 refugees had stopped.
In practice, however, is no longer a prospect to get asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke started cleaning up for workers.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks had left at the side of the road.
Sperrgitter were dismantled and one of the detention centre in the border town has been rebuilt.
The aim of this conversion, nobody wanted to speak.
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants, according to government data, but still in the country.
Wait in Salzburg about 1400 people on the journey to Germany.
Rail travel from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the instructions of German authorities.
In Freilassing met in smaller groups of refugees on foot on a regular basis.
Mayors "stranded" drove across the border
"We were busy with the cleanup after the bridge festival on Sunday, as a sudden ten people with travel suitcases stood at the entrance to the tent," says Wernsteins Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists that they wanted to take the train to Passau.
On Sunday, but because of the refugee flow had stopped rail traffic with Austria as a surprise, because Germany was happy for them in Wernstein closure, "says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded along with two other volunteers and their cars across the border near Passau.
Previously, we have the windfall guests once you with snacks and drinks.
We have said that we bring them to Passau by car.
"It was natural for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not have to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased about," says Stadler.
The stranded Zugpassagiere were switched on Sunday evening by a train in a regional train in the direction of Passau in Wels, in order to try it after the recent proclamation that the rail traffic was halted after Germany in the short term, but over the border.
The engine was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the Cross is generally held in high regard.
The bridges connected with the Bavarian neighbours sociable on Sunday, the day before a two bridges running sport, organized by the Union from Neukirchen Wernstein and Bavaria.
Now that Viktor Orbán sends many thousands more to us, is a logical outcome of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of in Röszke camp immediately to help with the construction of structures that ensure humanity our chancellor has high officially and publicly brought the attitude of the Hungarian government to the orbit of National Socialism.
Victim of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The area also will have to say that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed, is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge for us, given the ongoing refugee flows and the onset of winter, produce decent conditions for asylum seekers.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter solid quarters
Konrad has their hands full with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad, it is usual that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers set up headquarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos of the reception centre Traiskirchen, Konrad has already to get a grip on the situation.
"We have no more homeless in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday, is also without a big fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece."
The Home Office said instead of a "crisis situation."
Overall, Konrad expects with a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number must be found in the next few weeks still 35,000 accommodations - 20,000 should provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can create it.
"But it is not a bottomless pit," Konrad said.
Captains with the country he has already held talks.
They had assured him that even for the refugees to come to create districts.
"In Upper Austria, it is good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, it should be clarified how the church will help.
Great expectations as we help the asylum coordinator in the ORF action '. "
On the platform, individuals can offer simple accommodation.
Moreover, one hopes on hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for the accommodation as "very high" yesterday.
In times of need, it cannot be that service provider must comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the overhead lights.
"Emergency" ARDS should apply for a temporary period of time.
That, in contrast to the Home Office, he was successful in terms of accommodation, establishes Konrad with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman, you cannot simply say in the face of the untruth.
Persuasion is his main weapon.
Konrad and Maier cause no cost of the Republic, as she herself said.
Their number of employees want to increase it to three or four.
The district search has so far not been successful.
Konrad wanted to establish a container by inmates as an office.
But there are obvious problems with the approval.
Linz is calling for a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it could accommodate the affected at the moment without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, but further sites will be checked for their suitability.
Criticism of the city head to the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also need to contribute here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not closed off"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Governor Josef Pühringer akkordiert (VP) on Monday that further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not closed off.
The journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there is now just the appropriate controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany, there will be no more for the time being.
People seeking protection would, however, with regular trains to Germany.
Of the other EU member states, passed even more enhanced solidarity on the refugee issue.
Now that Austria also introduces controls at its borders, is a logical consequence for Pühringer '"from the approach taken by the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
Major overhaul of the new shipyard "in the Linz Industriezeile is officially closed.
In four of the six floors of office and production building, the stock exchange listed IT company S & T recovered, the rest (2,700 square meters) will be leased to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the wise heads are our raw material - and we need to try that they work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine, to invest in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later to acquire any.
Right from the beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - as Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros have been invested in the site of S & T, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which belongs to a third of the city of Linz, Upper Austria and Germany (FFG) each.
The building is leased by the Linz AG for 60 years in S & T and Tech Center.

Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday is the new shop in operation.
Previously, has been converted into several weeks.
"I have thought long and hard about this, however, whether I should open a shop," says wide.
The key to the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, also were taken with the idea of a separate site, which will only sell their handbags,.
"We are the only ones in the region Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has broadly get paid by her mother in the cradle.
Me most is when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women falling into rapture at the sight of a beautiful handbag, cannot answer the professional woman with the last security.
Perhaps it is because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from much
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a village whose inhabitants are called off.
This property combines some of the billionaire, wants to be the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for Aufreger.
Whether he is xenophobic journalists revealed Male regard or knowledge gaps in the policy of international crises - the candidate for the US presidency twists vigorously in the election campaign.
And is doing well here.
This is also registered in much stronger recovery, where the grandparents of Immobilienmilliardärs donors.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a concept many in the wine village on the wine route.
Some people in the village of 1200 inhabitants is about dozen corners is related to him.
His grandfather came from much in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I believe that somehow find this exciting, but are also not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter type," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has shot an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, which in addition to Trump, the Heinz ketchup family matters.
In "Kings of much" (2014), Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also to speak - as with the statement that he would certainly be successful, if he would live in much.
The king of hearts, he has not put it there.
While there is respect for the power of the family, but also tend to have the opinion that Trump "was a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, had the nickname that much was in the area, "The Brulljesmacher" - to much of the country: The show, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the show.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather immigrated and opened a restaurant in the United States for gold miners.
The foundation of the real estate company were first land purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents was not without tragedy: Her desire to return to the home in the long term, failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not include Trump because he once was hewn down without permission, had declared a film start of Roland Paul, director of the Institute for pfälzische history and folklore.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of descendants.
Had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the noise, it is not so nice," says Hans Bender, a distant relative of Trump's ("The grandmother was born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired vintner aufbrausend sees the Americans rather aloof, "he is always so."
Does he think that Trump is?
"I cannot imagine," says the 72 years old.
"He has never much bothered about."
Pension innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kallstadter arrived in a visit, a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ, which is generally good.
"I cannot imagine the Donald," says the 68 years old.
You think it would be better if he has not treated the election, because "the such radical views, I do not know whether this is a good thing."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States, he would have been, "he would never arrived at all."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"It is not my President," she says.
And: "The grapes are also ready for Trump without the president."
Wendels film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, have seen 12 000 moviegoers, also the interest awakened in the United States.

The plan is to use the site for a mixture of trade, industry and housing.
We await appropriate offers, it means on the part of the city.
What investor come into question, it is not yet clear.
Accordingly, are also not yet signed contracts.
The city of Emden, a portion of the property, which is located at the corner of Boulevard / Great street, had already bought a few months ago and the important building be demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the cottage settlement on the Little Sea in Emden take shape.
The investor said plans for the project for the first time in public.
A number of residents are still worried - they fear the selling off of their leisure sanctuary
For months had been negotiated behind closed doors, pondered, debated and scarred.
Now plans are on the table for a new cottage settlement on the Little Sea near Emden.
The prospective customer, the midsize Emder company "system building," said on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council his plans publicly for the first time.
Originally had this item on the public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP Group, which accuse the investors and the administration's secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system construction management went on the offensive: "We still do not have an answer to all the questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The expensive around ten to twelve million euro project is in the discussion for months.
Strong reactions among marine shops owners who had come to the meeting, called the images and new details on the desired Hotelbau.
Roberto Schulz, marine shops owner and a board member with the interests of the local residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a huge block that overlooks all the other building."
He like many other project critics also fear that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase sharply: "That whole Busladungen must come, so that it makes sense," says Schulz
What exactly is happening on the well a hectare site of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
Still, there is no operator.
"First we must have a more consistent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the building plans are also more variable.

Google launches Verdoppelungs - fundraising campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a Verdoppelungs fundraising campaign, which aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations, is intended to help the thousands of refugees who have overtaken the European nations, as they flee from the war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach with the announcement of the donations call on his blog.
Instead of a manager to make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about their personal experiences.
"On our trip included many dark rail and bus routes, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people such as my family are looking desperately for help.
The donations will go to four charities that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of $5.5 million on google.com / Refugee Relief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by four years of civil war in Syria, which has sold more than 4 million people this year.
Many people fleeing from the war torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya as well.

For slightly overweight diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether, after the weight loss surgery, slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer than those who received non surgical treatments.
"The mortality data will need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in Jama Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery have been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers used data from Taiwan's Min Sheng General Hospital since 2007, they have collected in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube education, medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who are subjected to this operation, fell from 31 to 24.5 in this study by the end of the fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI in those who received no surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal in 29
Among those who are subjected to a surgical operation, triggered the diabetes disease completely and some at 28% to 36%.
In the medically treated group was fully in just one percent in the comparison of diabetes and, in part, with only about two percent.
In addition, the results were generally better at the controls blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in the surgery group," the authors found.
The researchers monitored the patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, write the researchers.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level by about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as is reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reduced the mortality rate in five years, as the Chief researcher Dr. Chih Cheng HSU and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results from the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a more complete elimination of diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was in obese people, who have undergone obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone said, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group," no increased risk of death or a kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight is seriously, as soon as the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think that we have to wait until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies have strongly linked with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. "

"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end the violence in the country of origin of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama said in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom.
He claimed that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Look after several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long term solutions, such as a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he said.
Ultimately, we need to reflect on how the killing in their countries will be reduced.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of violence, said George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the United States is a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I have expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I said to him that the way to solve this problem is in nonviolence.
"I know that his motives were good, but he continued violence, and that has given rise to unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four times revenue increase of hand disinfectant by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report on a nearly 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12, swallow the strong alcoholic hand disinfectant, so the Georgia poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia poison Center report, increased the cases of revenue of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12, the poison control centers, from 3,263 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are more and more of these products, and, unfortunately, ends up with a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or because Mutprobe in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly disinfectants mixed with alcoholic mouth water to get a tougher drink.
Younger children can be enticed by attractive smells of disinfectant.
"A child does not, that this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectant) are the ones who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with textures, wine grape and orange scents that are very appealing to children.
Hands disinfectant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially for young children just a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center in the hospital of the University of Kansas, told the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So you would leave around a SIP of whisky, but people let this hand disinfectant to come within reach of children, and if children, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six year girl that had recently taken four splashes of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in school, was brought into an emergency room for treatment.
Your blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is regarded as a drunk at an adult by law, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated them at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah lallte her words and was not in a position to go, when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored overnight they had met with signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and the head in a separate children's hospital, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," said Scott Ortoria Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It would be fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers to use soft products or disinfectant wipes and hand disinfectants to keep out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after swallowing of hand disinfectants, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York, planned to poison their "nasty" teacher, by claiming antibacterial products around the classroom, "as it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned them from their space.
The police saw the failed plan as "chatter" and disciplinary action referred to the school authority.

Why I will be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma state penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already on his best friend for the first time in January, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day was nearing, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and as many more applications than places available, will take place a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Anyone who is selected, it will observe without emotion.
I cannot do that.
I will sit alongside Richard Glossips inner friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a visit to two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I must simply try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me to abandon my impartiality on Twitter.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
They admitted that they "can make it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things that I have said and written.
He tells me not what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter is present, in order to write.
When he dies, he thinks that will help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bell, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I am not going to go back on all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty, to be a beneficiary of the deed.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters, to whom you can turn for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death.
After moist police chase, he persuaded to come out of the canning River
The canning Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man from the canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth, the police treasure, was unsuccessful, as he was in the marshy and shallow water, only a few metres away from a police officer who tried to persuade "him gently to return to shore."
Canning Vale's police was called on Tuesday to a house of peace breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of canning River.
But he was not too far.
"He was in the water and said 'I have not come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan negotiated Perhavec was not too enthusiastic to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben cousins offers an unforgettable example.

Peter Moody claimed that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to quit the race immediately.
It was aimed at the stewards and the Integritäts Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they held a personal campaign against him for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday, with the late scratching of Lady Tatai.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing and he had found himself under difficult conditions, when it came to the cobalt positive swab test at Lidaris he cannot explain.
He had withheld 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it "look like at high hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say about it, and I've been sitting on this for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
They know that it went further.
Sometimes it reacts, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with that, what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to go around with my head held high, and I would like to think that my owner that I try my best for them.
If you start to think that I am not doing that, then I should no longer be the coach.
I have to consider, then, what I do with my license.
Moody had previously let the bomb in an interview with racing.com high that Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, whom I shall name, if I am asked, and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information about what I do in my stables," Moody said on Racing.
They obviously believe that I am a fraudster.
If this is the case, you should certainly take on their noses because they have failed in a bid to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of it at the time, and there are still today.
Should bring me to the view that it personally?
Has the RVL cowardly behaviour, and makes people outside of trainers may be responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps people think out there that I am.
They may have to take my license and offend me, and I have no doubt that what I say will consider it now.
But I'm now at the point where I think the matter is, and that makes me sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
Frustrations levels of trainers have built up with the prolonged cobalt investigation in Lidari, and the late scratching meant that he said that he "could take his license on the table."
Moody, best known for its preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the legs of horses, which was against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for that, "he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It would be so last night.
It would have been able to be so throughout the day yesterday, which was also so.
It was however on the day of the race.
Moody could be faced with a three month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race, has opened an investigation into this matter.
It is a joke.
People who set up these rules do not know about the horse.
"We all recognise that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes ring to fight back against rivals because of allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism at the tack of his players as "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed the Storm players "ring" struggles with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team, after his team had reached the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model" of the rugby league and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the struggle.
Bellamy, the Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were at the tack, focusing only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of the two leading trainers on his team made him confident agree, because it means that they are concerned, to be beaten by the Storm team.
"It appears over and over again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling fights, as they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that, throughout the year, we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has been the trend for us.
Trent is now there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not accustomed to lose, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how this appears again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked the Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and recalled his mentor, that Bennett's St George Illawarra dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long because a" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting the game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George has been criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said that he is a shit dirt will look into this matter.
But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game that you want to play, if you have these kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play the kind of football that everyone - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence, because they say these things, because they are a bit concerned, having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they have probably not thought of us, when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters reached a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two further attempts in our game, but this is an exciting game?
Or breaks and no points are a little bit more exciting?
For me, it is the game plans.
If you mention us, it means that we will meet in a stage on it.
The Storm team has this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park on Saturday night. The ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serbs with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man may face a life sentence because of his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which were smuggled to Queensland, was released on a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men who were arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, from South America to Vanuatu and plotting in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed, as he met his co in the marina in the course of the morning and later in Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life whole sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the entire amount and that the cafe for an innocuous reason might have been.
The judges on the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of flight in Maksimovic.
He has strong relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 deposit as security together, in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the oaths stately statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 security represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him, not to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he delivers his Australian and his Serbian passport, report daily to the police, and adheres to a curfew from 6: 00 to 06: 00.

JVA Berlin Tegel: Five square cell are degrading
The German constitutional court has given a former prisoner of the Tegel prison establishment right, which was housed in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.
That the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision published on Wednesday.
Those affected can even then hope for money, according to the judges, if they were only a few days locked in tight spaces (ref.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
Berlin Tegel between June and November 2009, so that a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: He was in the prison hospital, housed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Then the man, according to his lawyer has now been released, has been moved to a larger cell.
Although his office failed liability lawsuit against the country because of the inhumane conditions in Berlin.
But the constitutional judges stressed the judgment of the Kammergerichts Berlin and referred the case back for reconsideration.
They see violating the dignity of the man.
Chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if only a few days in jail for the compensation of the period in question were instrumental for legal reasons, was given a compensation claim, they said.
Otherwise, would be "an atrophy of legal protection of personality to fear."
The High Court must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation.
The constitutional judges have in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So she spoke only in April of a detainee in damages because he was locked naked in a cell.
Human dignity is, according to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday in the German Constitutional Court, which had certified a subhuman housing a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The former prosecutor was between 15 to 21 hours a day for three months in a similar cell, as in the case of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons were also due to lack of staff in the headlines in recent weeks.
Prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours that aggressiveness is rising, even with beatings should be already come there because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice press office 21 posts in Tegel are closed due to lack of talent, 19, 2016 should disappear.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create that"
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What comes to Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even capable of a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we do that."
What is in store for Germany gives the following overview.
Homes a year are needed for different forecasts between the Bundesbauministeriums 350000 (estimate) and 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) - and in the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as before is built choices (housing).
Dramatically, the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties: Every year, there are 60,000 to 80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing, and this particularly affordable housing refugees will also apply.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the promotion, from currently $518 million to one billion euros.
Far too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that the federal government would have to invest in a promotion to the tune of $6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and federal construction minister agree on is that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it can be assumed that 55 per cent of the area in the long term can be employed in Germany.
However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, is crucial, whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self - esteem of immigrants, says migration for Cher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, there has been a political change according to Thränhardt: The ban on work for refugees on the recognition of work.
While there was a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years in the past, this was limited to three months, as well as the residence requirement, the asylum seekers at a residence in November 2014.
In society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - mostly the view prevailed that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of German language skills.
So far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most commonly transmitted through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is the royal road to integration work according to Thränhardt.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents give their children in the key signature, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents only once, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.
The family still to be convinced of the benefits of this option, the administration distributed hand slip in different languages.
Should the need for educators to rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing multiple schools.
In those countries, students are not prepared to welcome classes on the teaching of English.
But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, including from teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers Schulverwaltung from Berlin.
The Deutsches Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or patience, the study - the only exception has been Berlin, Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitating access to university.
For refugees with a residence permits or more if they begin a study of asylum seekers will receive no benefits under the current law.
The latter are generally no Bafög, since they do not fall within the circle of people entitled to trainees.
CADTM refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years, to be Bafög - justified, in that span is shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016.
This funding gap needs to be closed, however, claim crash, Berlin's undersecretary for science, and the Deutsches Studentenwerk Steffen.
The students should receive Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should give the same rights to Islam gradually as they have the churches, and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religions relationship.
It would also be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association of professional cares about the new arrivals.
Belong to the rights and obligations.
As the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and to give him some control.
This includes the willingness to take bold action against religious fundamentalism.
Ayman Mazyek, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany on Thursday.
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany "have forfeited their right to dwell here, in Germany, immediately," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration will be much more than an issue of the whole society today in the future.
It will also have to change the majority of society, will be pressing the elimination of discrimination and racism.
Germany has a point against discrimination and a general equality law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the spirits - murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all, not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups have been demanding and what international agreements such as the Anti Racism Convention oblige Germany needs to become a reality in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities, for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to supply the refugees expected to date medically, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"With regard to MAN power and capabilities, we create it," he told the daily mirror.
However, should make extra money flowing into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, calls for Montgomery, hand over all arrivals for the registration of health cards.
Services provided could be charged later with the provinces.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to mislead so many people with a limited catalog of performance, the performance of the asylum law propose.
Otherwise, the doctors are, above all, to create the language barriers.
So far, it has proven the Berlin Gesundheitswissenschaftlerin Thea Borde, migrants are less aware of their disease than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be accepted, she asks.
Many refugees would have helped but even with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic views.
Among refugee children, for example, will give it much more unprocessed disability, and go to HIV awareness among young people.
German doctors came with the images of some other disease in terms of their education but clear, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infections and tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as regards the shortage of doctors is perhaps even relief in sight by the refugees.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their skills, however, and may once again professional examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychotherapists (BPtK): Most are suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK explains.
A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder is ill, including so called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, and palpitation Todesängsten.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, strong shock and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms were chronic, early treatment is needed, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Mentally ill asylum seekers in social services can make a request for psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.
Most clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness, in social services would also decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz said.
Manezh invites one to dream
With the new staging of "passion" the Circus Probst back to the traditions of circus arts.
The goal is to draw every age group in the spell of amazing acrobatics, animal dress and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst on the brick in the Manege wasen invites you to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I cannot imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior officer.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current Manegeninszenierung.
For more than 33 years, the circus is in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift to inspire the family is so in the blood.
"Us, it is important that wegzuholen people from their daily routine and take them for two hours in a completely different world," said the 27 year old junior officer.
"Manegencocktail flair of a cosmopolitan city," Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
This flair can now see 50 cities on the tour almost 3 000 kilometres long.
The program convinced of the circus with talented artists from all over the world.
An award at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, Russian Stoliarov clown family draws the audience with wit and charm in the world.
The Castillo brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent movies, it wants to include the Cuban duo locker.
Lightness and agility - with these words, they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is women's hearts by storm.
In addition to the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinated by many great bursts with sensitivity and suppleness.
With the unicycle balance on a ball?
No problem for the yuan.
Snakes fascinate and frighten people.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family," said Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuse in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes this position: "It is not good for our animals, it is also not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each canvas of pranks.
The "four legged artists," as they are affectionately called, is to read each desire of the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal feel unwell, it is also not in the riding school.
So the top priority: Good care for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra filly, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived in an enclosure together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, there was our small Jumbo," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is still not ready for the riding school, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst, however.
For every visitor should therefore be something.
"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and do it with all my heart."
The Circus Probst invites at 17 and 20 from 17 to 20 September on a daily basis to his ideas.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 and 16: 00.
Thursday is uneven, prices are reduced for the presentation at 17: 00.
In addition, the animal show is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year by a panel.
He remained unhurt, but the video of the event spread quickly on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by allegations of members of the opposition, that they had received anonymous death threats and they have been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with Buhrufen.
Last month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politician received text messages on their phones, they are being warned to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number which is not shown, but it has the title of 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Parliament members concerned that the immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "concerned" about the dangers for the politicians.
Hewlett Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett Packard is expected of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and Einsparungs - efforts to reduce the company's services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and its services business.
The expected job cuts will lead to a load of more than $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring will allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, to lead the unit after the separation.
"HP Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses, the companies support the transition to a new style of doing business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses," according to a statement of the company.
It disperses a company that was founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to the graduates of Stanford University in the 1930s, in order to establish electric plants and their Palo Alto garage has called it "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the belief that narrowly focused companies provide a better performance.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere, that it was only in September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had found the last season had finished strong after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing back during the early season.
"This type of injury threatened not to pursue a career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that has not healed well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study by Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs who have recorded the most violation days in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat force," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body is stabilised, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players that we need to take a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F, the kebabs stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds in Europe with the biggest intimidation effect.
Dynamo is also after 41 games unbeaten after the "invincible" campaign has been launched in the last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.
This year, it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learnt the lesson of the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope, with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business, in order to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
Friends: The comedy show, which grants us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now has become even more desperate than ever, as shown on a 15 year high suicide rates among young men.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of calling into question the culture that prevents men to seek help if they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight, in order to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that, if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy" mood, doubled his chances of recovery.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first, so a friendship can work.
In the age of communications conducted on social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, funny and successful life, even if in reality dominates the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a profound impact on our mental health.
And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money cannot buy happiness really.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but his personality, which was due to the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing between Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my audience role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel unable to talk with friends.
The old saying "I come to make sense of it" has a huge impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness, if you talk about problems openly. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more permanent management mechanisms.
They clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status on the phone may also help the people in times of despair, the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central friends stuck with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink with the Central perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone just sitting around in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - tied for # friends

With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they not only want the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of goal. He was replaced later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2: 0 to cause problems to our opponents and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things that in the course of the season, we have yet to perfect," said Blanc.
"This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet reached one or two more goals. "
Manuel returned in one of three changes in the Paris team after his injury, which could keep a 2: 2 draw against Bordeaux on home ground in the league at the weekend, but he has been surpassed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been described as the man, the PSG can take to the next level in Europe, when it was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he hinted at why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the defence in Malmö, before he graduated nicely in the corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, if someone believed that PSG would make a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmö, which beat Celtic in a play off, in order to reach this stage, came with nine national players on the field at Anpiff and strung with a five man defence and two deep in the midfield was a serious opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic went far past Kevin Music posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG patzte even sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not least by Inter, with no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
However, he showed much more skill, which was directed by Wiland past the post in the 52nd minute, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Manuel Di Maria turned into a spin shot...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter had got a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended any thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could keep low, before substitute players was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, announced later that PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris. "
It was a great game from them.

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a previously anonymous place on Wednesday in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized in the name of the German Reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now a "German theologian of the reformation."

Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns (gilt) is one of the main works Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible now appeared with beautiful images.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with bright colors and imaginative forms has received the 75 years old - but by no means is synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, adapted to the particular issues, it may well seem rather bleak.
Around three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has taken from the many areas of the "book of all books" a subjective artistic choice.
The result are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as crossroads, plagues, bids or Our Father.
He is fascinated on several partners: This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost who has dealt with the relevant biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so on Today, "translated" in the current context.
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting.
They are between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one sentence each of the artist, who has put his own personal thoughts on the current situation.
The jewelry box has golden letters.
This allows the 75 year - old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Christmas orders at all.
"Since the education with the cane ever happened," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to do the father come to me perhaps again with the Lord."
His second concern was to help the art at the time passes back to more importance: "The perception of worlds is now dominated by advertising, and is loud.
Symbolism is out there.
Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things.
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt would discover that the viewer into the images' fall ', they can act on it, and feel what power they have: "The picture is his counterpart."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always been" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he sees life with his pictures."
Age did not care to fully comprehend the Bible, but are important to him, also selected mysterious issues.
"This was no cooperation on an equal footing," all old post explained: "This is about the images, the text says." The result is a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler from publishers Luther is this work to find an invitation, "to deepen his life and freedom."
Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler both the responsibility and the (biblical) language of love.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which opened on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation.

The national player is the table leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m. / Sky) are missing.
"We cannot rely on him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
If Reus will be again on Sunday in the Bundesliga's top match against Leverkusen, BVB coach openly: "We expect a return of him in training on Friday."
Given the high cost of its professionals, Tuchel's Stammelf change not only on the position of Reus.
So, he announced a change to the goalkeeper position.
Therefore novel wicker state takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained on an absolute top level," praised the football coach of the world champion.

Robot cars: Government will lead to Germany
Germany should be technological advancements in the transformation of the car after the will of the federal government.
The federal cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new automotive era on Wednesday on the sidelines of the IAA auto show in Frankfurt."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide for less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He will also discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry.
The strategy of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
The testing of new technology is currently a test track at the Highway 9 in Bavaria.
To be saddled with the driver "no additional liability risks," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."
Like Germany, for example, internationally to ensure that the speed limit for cars drive themselves will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h.
The federal government will also push for a revision of the Vienna Convention, which so far only the people as drivers.
In automated driving takes the lead in increasing the car, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the surroundings and process the information in a matter of seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry, highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Yet driverless vehicles on public roads "were to be expected until well after 2020."
The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany, the study's authors estimate for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency on the road," said the SPD politician Sören Bartol.

Yet the Germans see cars drive themselves skeptical, however, much more than the French or Americans.

In France, 21 percent of respondents expect 33% by 2025 with autonomous driving cars in the United States.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to cede control over the entire ride on all roads.
On the motorway could imagine that as much as 15% in flowing traffic, 45 percent in a traffic jam.
Good one in four car would leave the control under any circumstances.

They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was with her stage outfits for the big star of the fashion scene, among other things, and that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture, because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, now it is real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which is to be seen in the Kunsthalle der Hypo - Cultural Foundation from September 18, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial opposition to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made station in Montreal, Canada and in Paris.
"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It was about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the little plant to have views of the man who has made history of fashion without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
Chronologically, the show has not been established, but it is an excellent choreographiertes total art work, for which there was a great deal of effort: To cook the puppets, for example specially hired a stylist.
14 tons of material, the makers have that according to the curator Thierry Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a special treat: A leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Horse animal old teddy is on display in the exhibition.
It is fashionable for the first, tentative steps of the designer.
As a child (he was a good student and a bad thing in football), he attracted to his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
His parents would not allow him to play with a doll.
The design of fashion, he taught themselves later.
He stole fashion magazines and was told the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.
Later, I bought it of course.
For his first own fashion show, he cannot pay for the models.
You got nothing, but could keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - "head as a fashion niche
Before it went to the long stick machines in and around Plauen, to make metres.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were further processed in large quantities for customers such as blankets and curtains.
That alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of Plauen fashion tip.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
In the early days of the "top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: Head in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At Stanford University, called the vintage fashion, much of past eras, an increasing order potential.
Anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen lace and embroidery is a member along with nine other companies in the industry association. "
Only they can bear the protected label.
In the last 15 years has about 80 percent of sales.
Private shops and wholesale, there is almost no more.
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly.
The mass manufactured goods will be much cheaper in Asia today and sold almost exclusively on chains.
Also, the export schwächle, currently in Russia and in the United States.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we produce a quality seal, which shows that we are ecologically and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches Berger in the snow of Westsächsischen Hochschule Zwickau, at the Faculty of Applied Arts, and specializes in embroidery and lace.
Find high quality and innovative products to counter the competition from the Asian region.
This takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the businesses in particular need to think economically, "Schmidt said.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly in order to keep a customer base.
A few years ago revived the historic pyramid top textile designer Kati Reuter.
The machine uses small beads in some places.
The "gold champion Bianca Hallebach Krauße could inspire them:" Before I could not start with traditional "top."
Now she uses the pyramid tip for her jewelry.

"Many people in the region identify with the subject" tip - young and old, "Reuter said.
It also supplies in the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers, whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento.
I see my jewelry as modern ambassadors of the "tip.

EU wants to double mercury limit in Raubfischen
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and expect consumers to a much higher dose of nerve gifts.
The consumer organisation Food Watch before an appropriate working paper the EU sharply criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy will be passed on to pregnant women and infants with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt Foodwatch.
According to Wolf Schmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for big fish at the end of the food chain such as swordfish or Hai- for "economic reasons" are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury, however, that cannot be sold on the basis of the current limits of about 50 percent of the catch.
After doubling the limit only 14.5% would become unsaleable.
In return for the easing the EU according to Food Watch wants to tighten limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Food Watch described it as a "trick" because smaller peaceful fish such as carp are usually charged so low that they already comply with the planned levels.
The reduction in small fish is "a perfides diversionary tactic, that alone will help the economy," Wolf Schmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for the people that greatly enriching themselves through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government warns that that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system," especially in unborn.
The Environment explains on its website in relation to the current levels, however, that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury gets into the environment by coal combustion.
The German coal plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, according to a written information of the German Federal Ministry for Environment of the Greens - federal MPs Annalena Baer Bock, two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube is "permanent and nationwide," the "mirror" in March was quoted in the paper.
Last year included warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU RASFF alert system throughout Europe.
